            <div class="det-abstract"> Wetlands, important habitats to bird species, have suitable conditions for breeding activities as well as constitute stopover sites at least to feeding or resting during migration activity of birds. The diversity of birds in an area indicates that the environment is healthy in ecological terms, and the greatest need of such areas is to remove negative effects from human based activities. Yazır Dam, the place where the study was carried out; has a 360 ha pond within the borders of Süleymanpaşa District of Tekirdağ Province. It is located at North latitude 40° 55' 7"N and East longitude 27° 24' 40"E. The study was carried out from September 2017 to January 2022 disclosing that a total of 84 species belonging to 12 different orders approached the study site and 30 species of them were waterbird. When the birds are evaluated according to their status in the area, it can be determined that 50 are resident species and 34 are migratory or transit species. Also, it can be concluded that Yazır Dam is an area where the population densities of its species can increase rapidly with the reduction of anthropogenic effects.</div>
