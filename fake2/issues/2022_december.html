        Journal of Balkan Science and Technology (JBST), which started its publishing life with its first issue in 2022, tries to serve the world of science as an international refereed journal within the framework of scientific ethical rules and quality. JBST is a high-quality double-blind refereed journal. JBST serves as a platform for researchers and scientists to present their new ideas, innovate science and contribute to the literature. Having included research articles from various science fields since 2022, JBST has decided to continue with publications from fields such as Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Agricultural and Food Sciences and Architectural Sciences.
